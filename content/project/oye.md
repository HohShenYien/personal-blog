This is the first **full web application** that I have ever done. <h-link href="https://oye.events">OYE</h-link> is an 
event planning startup that I joined in 2021. Various service planning tools **especially for weddings are included**
in this website. It was a rather
tough work to me because I just learned about Vue and Laravel about a week before starting the project. Furthermore,
I was also participating in a <h-link href="hackathon.data.gov.my/">one-month hackathon</h-link>.

## Job Scope

I was tasked to build a **full website builder** also known as **E-Album** based on a prototype in figma. Starting from
**creating a database structure**, to **building the backend** and finally **constructing the frontend** were in my scopes.

## Features

* Add or remove any component
* Edit each component's text and images
* A unique album management interface for gallery component
* Set website name
* Set website visibility
* Set a color palette and font combinations for all texts
