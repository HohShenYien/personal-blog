This was technically my **first** complete web project. I have always wanted to build a personal website for myself, but
due to lack of knowledge, never had one until this CS Diary. Then, I came across this 
<h-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOInE7-E0I" target="_blank">YouTube video</h-link>
about **creating blogs with Rmd files** which inspired me to create my first personal blog website.

A lot of effort have been put into customizing various aspects in the website, including **light and dark mode, 
staticman comments and the blog contents**. However, after learning about using NPM with the various packages available
that are much easier than online scripts, switching framework was necessary for me. Thus, the old site is 
abandoned and replaced with this new website.

Previously, I used one of the <h-link href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">Github Student 
Development Packages </h-link> to get a free domain name <h-link href="https://csdiary.me">csdiary.me</h-link> (It might
be expired already) and hosted it on <h-link href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</h-link>. It was very
convenient as the deployment done without needing to set it up at all. 

Despite using <h-link href="https://beautifuljekyll.com/">Beautiful Jekyll</h-link> as starter theme, I have learnt
a lot in **using css, creating responsive website and writing my own Javascript**. These formed a strong
foundations in building this website.
