## Background

Asia Pacific Analytics Club is the club I am joining in university. I have decided to build a website for the club,
so here it goes. Beside displaying the info, the website can receive responses from visitors to
fill in the form which then will be stored in backend.

Besides, in consideration that the future committee may not be fluent in React, or javascript overall,
so I have created multiple data files to store json objects of the data, where changes can be
made to just the data files instead of editing the other React components.

## Job Scope

Although I am the Project Lead, I am the only one building the frontend. Nevertheless, another
fellow committee <highlighter>@Hui Ying</highlighter> did help to code out the backend, and
I just reviewed her codes to ensure no error.

This website was my first attempt in using React, and it was surprisingly a good experience!
