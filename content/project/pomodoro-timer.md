My first attempt into creating a desktop application with Qt framework and C++. Nothing much special, just a pomodoro
app that is capable of counting down and send notification. 

## Features
* Has two versions, Windows and Linux (However, I am not sure how to create a .deb file for Linux yet, so I include the software file directly)
* Allows you to set the duration for focus and rest periods.
* Colorful UI with cute icons.
* Unique sounds upon completion.
* Displays the total focus time at completion.
* Sends notification on session change.
