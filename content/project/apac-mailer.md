This is a desktop application that helps to send emails in bulk easily with certificate generator function. 

The first version of the app only took me a mere 2 days to complete, nevertheless, there were several issues associated with it.
It then took me some time to slowly adjust the codes to optimize the functionalities.

## Inspiration

I started building this app looking at my fellow committee <highlighter>@Hui Ying</highlighter> taking
a long time to send emails to participants during club events. Thus, I decided to use my
knowledge to help solve this issue and speed up the process.

Overall, I would say using Electron to build apps is a very satisfying process
because it is very easy, and the various web functionalities can just be used on the go. 
Furthermore, various npm libraries have certainly made the process much easier!
