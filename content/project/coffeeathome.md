## Job Scope

The project has been started before I joined, thus, some parts of the project were done, and I had to take over from there
to complete the remaining tasks.

I was tasked to build the **customer and staff views optimized for mobile phones** based on the designers' requirements. I 
was **more involved with frontend** as the backend was about 70%-80% done when I took over. Nevertheless, I needed
to complete the remaining backend codes as well. Besides, I also created **an analytics page** based on the data that
have been collected throughout the event.
