This was the **first** Android project that I started after going through
<h-link href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x">CS50</h-link> Android track. Though simple and mostly based on the codes
from the instructor, I managed to add some of my own features in it. Nevertheless, this app is a relatively simple
beginner Android app.

## Features
* Able to set your own username and profile picture that'll be saved.
* Browse up to 7 generations and 800 pokemons!
* Browse pokemons according to their generations.
* Catch and browse pokemons caught.
* Up to 8 different background colors for pokemons
* A brief information of every pokemon
* A search button to search your favourite pokemon!
