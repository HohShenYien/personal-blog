description: A simple efficiency mobile app that utilises pomodoro technique

My second and first fully independent Android app! Unlike my previous 
<nuxt-link to="/project/pokedex"><h-link>Pokedex</h-link></nuxt-link>, I did not follow anyone's codes and built
mine from scratch. It was submitted as the final project for <h-link href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x">CS50</h-link> course, and
it is featured in <h-link href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/gallery/">CS50's Gallery</h-link>.

The **hardest part** about building this app was tracking system's active apps in Java and creating white list where the apps
can be accessed. I remember that this app took me **a whole week** to fully complete it! Even up until today, I'm still
very proud of this app (though still have some bugs).

## Features

* Enables you to utilise fully Pomodoro technique without distraction.
* Block unlisted apps during focusing mode.
* Fully personalised pomodoro periods by customising your own durations.
* Make your own white list.
* Check the past records of your pomodoro sessions and compare it with others!
* Different motivation quotes on starting and on breaking app rules.
* Unique sound upon completion.
