was the female protagonist of Shakespeare's <h-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_Lucrece">The

## The Poem

<quote>
What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?<br>
A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.<br>
Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?<br>
Or sells eternity to get a toy?<br>
For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?<br>
Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,<br>
Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down
</quote>

I came across this poem from Covey's <h-link href="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-Teens/dp/1476764662">
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens</h-link>. After reading it, this poem struck me in the heart and quickly
became one of my life mantra.

### Background

The lines were uttered by Tarquin while he is trying to decide whether to give in to his passion and
rape Lucrece (which he did, unfortunately) after hearing about how gorgeous she is from her husband, who is also 
Tarquin's best friend.

### Analysis

This poem should be rather clear to anyone with a decent grasp in English. It was basically telling how 
succumbing to desire will do no good to the person. What we gain from it is often incomparable to the side 
effects that came along with it.

As a result, I will always keep this piece of poem in mind 
when great desires hit me, so that I do not lose my mind and make mistakes.

### Why

Honestly, I don't know, but I guess it is simply because it is rare for me to like poem? I am not a big fan of language
since young, but this poem just somehow came into my liking, which I still like for almost 2 years now.
