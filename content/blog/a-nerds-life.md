After looking back, I noticed that my past few months have mostly been sitting whole day in front of my laptop. 
Thus, this is an update of what I have been doing for the past few months as well as the life of a nerd.

## Daily Life

### Morning

Usually, I browse some Facebook in the morning in the bed or catching some extra sleeps before I get up.
I know it's not a good habit, and I am still finding ways to overcome this bad habit to start my day more productively.
Then, I follow a workout video from <h-link href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChloeTing">Chloe Ting</h-link>, though I might break 
sometimes when I'm getting busy or when I procrastinate (luckily it wasn't that often).

After showering, I'll have my breakfast and begin my dailies in front of my laptop.

### Classes

My classes usually range from 8.30 a.m. - 6.30 p.m. Of course, there are quite some long breaks in between some days
and other days it won't start as early or end earlier. However, frankly speaking, I'm not an attentive student,
and I don't usually (as in most of the time) pay attention to classes. Normally, I will only pay attention
when it comes to assignment, and rewatch certain recordings if those parts are needed. 

During these periods, I will be doing my own learnings, assignments, side projects, my part-time works or 
browsing social media instead. Of course, I know that I am basically wasting my money on the university, 
however, most of the contents taught are either irrelevant, or I have self-studied them before. 

### Evening

Honestly, after dinner, I'm doing the same thing. I will be in front of my laptop again and doing
the same. 

This concludes what a nerd will do every day. Even in the weekends, I am mostly doing the same.
Of course, I don't lock myself in my own room, throughout the day, I still interact with my family, 
and text my friends.

## Self Study

Despite the heavy assignments, I still managed to study some technologies that I have been interested with
or those that will benefit me in the future.

### Rust

Among all, I must admit Rust is something that's mind-blowing to me. I learned it through the book
<h-link href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</h-link> with exercises from
<h-link href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</h-link>. I had some doubts on this
language previously, like is this not something like another C or C++. Till I started reading, it fascinated
me.

The various features like ownership and zero null made me realized how powerful this language is! 
However, it is still pretty limited in software development, but as I wanted to practice it, I 
started another project, Pomodo, yet another pomodoro timer application, with the use of 
<h-link href="https://tauri.studio/">tauri</h-link>, hoping that I get to improve my Rust along the way.

### Angular & Typescript

Wasn't a big fan of Angular all along after knowing that the codes for a component are divided into 4 files,
but after learning it, again, I was fascinated. The structure was so organized and very neat, helped me to 
navigate easily between the html codes, styles and scripts. 

Along the way, I also learned and got better with Typescript, which I didn't bother learning
previously because I see it as a typed Javascript (which wasn't exactly wrong), and again, realized its
power. Frankly speaking, just like Rust, Typescript can really help in preventing possible bugs
in the codes from the start.

Thus, to practice my Angular, the Pomodo project is written in Angular.

### Ruby on Rails

I have been using exclusively Laravel/PHP in development. While I am aware of Django/Python, Express/Node and
Ruby on Rails. Nevertheless, as one of my dream companies uses Ruby on Rails as their backend implementation,
I also decided to pick it up. It wasn't easy as Ruby is an entirely new language to me, but I am attempting
to build a full-fledged web app that stores points (for fun ðŸ˜†).

### UI/UX

I won't call myself a good designer, and I am more used to designing simple ones like
<h-link href="https://apu-apac.netlify.app"></h-link> instead of nicer looking ones. Thus, I decided to take
on Google's <h-link href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design">UX Design Course</h-link>
course. I am learning a lot from this course as I didn't get any formal education on this. A lot that 
I didn't consider previously like accessibility, user's experience and prototyping which I am learning here.

## Work

During this period, I have 2 ongoing projects that I needed to manage. 

### Part Time

I am working as a part-time developer at <h-link href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/quintagen-tech/">Quintagen Tech</h-link>
for many months as of now already. I was assigned to develop a fully customized Wordpress website. Though using
Wordpress, I managed to learn a lot of CSS & JQuery as these are needed to customize the default components. 

### Freelance

The other day, I was just browsing <h-link href="https://www.upwork.com">upwork</h-link> and tried my luck
by applying on some of them. One of them, however, did contact me back which began my journey of 
freelancing (probably ðŸ¤”). This definitely increased my workload, but it is a good experience for me 
and pave my way for freelancing. 

## Summary

Initially I thought I wasn't doing much these few months, nevertheless, as I wrote them out, what I have
done have surprised myself too! Some self realizations happened in deciding my path 
(<h-link href="/blog/new-direction">Refer to this article</h-link>), learned quite a number of technologies,
started a few projects, read some books, and nurtured some good habits in myself.
Overall, I guess these few months have been quite a success for me! ðŸ¤©
