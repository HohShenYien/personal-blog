It's been so long since I started building this website, and finally it is done!

## New Technology

This website is built with <h-link href="https://content.nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank"> Nuxt Content</h-link>
</post-image>

Unlike the old <h-link href="hohshenyien.github.io" target="_blank">CS Diary</h-link> which was based on Jekyll and Bootstrap 
with the template from <h-link href="https://beautifuljekyll.com/" target="_blank">Beautiful Jekyll</h-link>,
I have built this whole website with <h-link href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank">Nuxt</h-link> and
<h-link href="https://vuetifyjs.com/" target="_blank">Vuetify</h-link>. The main reason of my rebuilding was due to
the difficulty in customizing the contents with a template built by others üòû. Besides, it was **much easier
to use Nuxt compared to Jekyll**, at least from my experience.

### How did I Discover it?
I was aware that Jekyll is one of the site generators in 
<h-link href="https://jamstack.org/generators/" target="_blank">Jam Stack</h-link>, and I found Nuxt which uses Vue as the
framework. Because of my great experience in Vue, I decided to give it a try (it was definitely a wise choice). 
After googling for quite a bit, I came into this amazing
<h-link href="https://blog.openreplay.com/building-your-own-blog-with-nuxt-content-and-tailwind" target="_blank">guide</h-link>
for building blog with Nuxt Content which basically guided me through the whole process. 

## Inspiration

It wasn't easy to decide upon the style of this website, so as a programmer, I looked at (stole) the designs from other websites.
I discovered this cool <h-link href="https://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank">Awwwards</h-link> which lists
many other websites that have 
<h-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awwwards" target="_blank">innovative web design</h-link>. From there,
I looked at many others' portfolio websites among which these gave me the best inspirations:

### 1. Kuon Yagi Portfolio

<h-link href="https://kuon.space" target="_blank">Kuon Yagi Portfolio Page</h-link>
</post-image>

I was very impressed when I saw his stylish and cool portfolio website. 
His website inspired many components of my website such as using 
<h-link href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">Animate on Scroll</h-link> library to add animations when scrolling and
page transition animations. 

### 2. Diegovz

I won't say his website is simplistic, but the design feels like just right for me. The tiny little animations
caught my eyes (and I did copy some of them üòé). 

Both of the websites brought a lot of inspirations to me when I was building mine here. It definitely wasn't
an easy task to copy some components from their website as they use different technologies (Diegovz used Wordpress),
and I did innovate some of mine.

## Design

At start, I wanted to build around a **dark theme with gold-ish colors** (no idea why I chose gold ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Then,
to align with my content, I planned to have an overall **futuristic** feel. I won't say I'm very good at designing, but
this is what I got in the end.

Besides, I tried to adhere to some of <h-link href="https://material.io/design" target="_blank">Material Design</h-link>
guidelines. Some of which that kinda helped me was typography, spacing and readability, though I didn't manage
to follow all of them.

## Conclusion

It was definitely a good experience to build something from scratch, learning more in-depth about Vue, SCSS, and Nuxt.
Many things that I thought would be impossible turned possible when I started doing it. Overall, I would say I am
satisfied with my own work here!
