I have just completed this amazing book, 
<h-link href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Decide-Simple-Making-Choices-ebook/dp/B07TRJB3S3">How to Decide</h-link> by Annie Duke recently! 
I have decided to start writing book reviews as a note to future self.

## Overall Comment

The book was very well-structured, with each topic linking back to previous topics naturally. This helped me
in remembering previous techniques that were taught and how they link with each other as a whole. 

There are also many useful activities given in the book and a concise end of chapter notes that further helped me strengthen the knowledge.
I would give it a **4.5/5** and would definitely recommend it to other people.

## Importance of Decision

One thing that intrigues me immediately I read the book was what determines how life turns out:
**luck and the quality of the decisions**.

<quote>The only thing you have control over that can influence the way your life turns out is the quality of your decisions.
<template v-slot:author>Annie Duke</template>
</quote>

And how many decisions we are making each day? How many of them are significant? Sometimes we neglect the
importance of the decisions we made for their abundance in our life, but the important question here is: 
**Can we improve how we make decisions?**

Here comes the main theme of the book: **Simple Tools for Making Better Choices**.

## How do we Learn from the Past?

We may think that the past is past, but there might be invaluable knowledge that we can extract from them, 
**especially from the decisions that we have made**. 

### 1. Avoid Resulting

<quote>Luck exerts its influence between your decision and which of the possible paths you end up on.
<template v-slot:author>Annie Duke</template>
</quote>

We really need to be aware that **not all bad outcomes are due to bad decisions**, some may come from bad luck!
Similarly, **not all good outcomes are due to good decisions**, it may be because of dumb luck. This effect of outcome
on our thought process is also known as **resulting** (or outcome bias).

Thus, when we look into the past decisions that we have made, we shouldn't just grieve over the failures and feel good about
all successes. Instead, we need to **assess the quality of the decisions independent of the outcome**! 

e.g., John borrowed $10,000 from a local bank to spend it all in a casino. He did win a huge sum in the end, but was it
a good decision?

### 2. Avoid Hindsight Bias

After reading this book and enjoying it, I may tell myself, "I should have read this earlier!". However, the question is,
how would I know that this book is amazing before reading it? 

This phenomenon is what we called a **hindsight bias**. The illusion that **I knew what I have just learnt**.

Therefore, we can keep a **Knowledge Tracker** to keep track of what we know before and after we make a decision
to avoid the bias. This will allow us to better assess the situation: "Are we making the optimistic decision **given
what I knew?** "

### 3. There are Many Possible Outcomes

Linking to <h-link go-to="1-avoid-resulting">#1</h-link>, after an outcome, we may think that it is
inevitable and must happen. However, in reality, it is just one of the many possibilities that happened due to
luck. 

As we examine, we should identify the role of luck in the outcomes such that **it may be just a bad luck or a dumb luck**
instead of blaming or feeling too good about your own decisions.

The three tools mentioned will import how we determine which of the decisions are good and which are bad. Then, 
we can learn from the decisions as a lesson to the future self when we are making decisions.

## Making Better Decisions

Learning from the past will help us in assessing future decisions, but how do we assess future decisions? Here are some
tools provided by Annie.

### 1. Preference, Payoff and Probability

Just like a typical pros and cons table, we should construct a decision & outcome tree like
<h-link go-to="1-decision-table">this</h-link> and for each outcome (of course it is unfeasible to list out all outcomes,
we should just list the most likely/significant outcomes) ,
we consider **how much do we like** (preference), 
**how much it'll help in achieving our goal** (payoff), and **how likely is it going to happen** (probability).

<post-image id="3p-tree" img="https://i.imgur.com/HPROzOBl.png" alt="Decision Tree"
lazy="https://i.imgur.com/HPROzOBt.png">

</post-image>

In this context, the experience we got from the past is what helps us identify the 3P's for each possible outcome. Besides,
to simplify our thought process, we can use **common English** (likely, unlikely, rarely, might happen) to estimate the
probability.

Meanwhile, the payoff can be considered from the aspect of **potentials**. **Upside potential** is the possible
gain while **downside potential** is the possible loss. Then, we will compare does the upside potential outweighs the
downside potential, and how is the probabilities? 

Of course, just plain consideration of payoff or preference is insufficient, we look at the probability as well. For 
instance, looking at the <h-link go-to="3p-tree">decision tree</h-link>, although the upside potential is huge for 
the first 2 decisions, so are the downside potentials.

Equally important is the probability! Upside potential is impossible to occur while downside potential is likely 
to occur. Thus, we decide not to take the decisions due to the highly likely downside potential. 

### 2. Bullseye Estimation

<post-image img="https://i.imgur.com/5I4vkudl.jpg"
lazy="https://i.imgur.com/5I4vkudt.jpg" alt="A bullseye image">
How close is your prediction from bullseye?
</post-image>

Yes, one outcome could be unlikely and the other may be impossible. What about an outcome that is possible and 
another that is likely? How do we know which one is **more _likely_** to occur? 

To some, likely might mean a 60% chance of occurring, and others, 70%. When we are consulting our friends for the
decisions, how will they give accurate advice if the common ground is in fact not common? (refer to
<h-link href="https://hbr.org/2018/07/if-you-say-something-is-likely-how-likely-do-people-think-it-is" target="_self">this article</h-link>)

The solution? <h-link href="http://www.probabilitysurvey.com/">Quantify your terms</h-link> and compare it with
your friends. 

Finally, prediction is not just a hit-and-miss thing, it can have a range too! After predicting the likelihood of 
an outcome to happen, give it an upper and lower boundary that passes the **Shock Test**. We should try our best
to define a range such that if the true value falls out of the range, we will be shocked!

<quote>The goal is to set the narrowest range you can, where you would still be <i>pretty shocked</i> if the bullseye wasn't in the range.
</quote>

### 3. View from Outside

</post-image>

This image really got me here. There are so many times in life we were too focused with our **inside view**, that is,
our own perspectives based on our own beliefs and experiences. This view is unavoidable and will bring disasters to us
in decision-making sometimes.

Of course, most of us are aware of this, but how do we avoid it? Obviously, one way is by looking at the problem objectively 
from the **outside view**, how other people would see our situation.  We know this too, but it is difficult.

So, what should we do? The following biases are a no-no that we need to avoid:

#### a) Confirmation bias

We tend to only notice and seek for information that confirms our beliefs rather than those that contradict.

#### b) Disconfirmation bias

When the information that contradicts our beliefs appear, we will be stricter and try to argue against it.

#### c) Overconfidence

Who doesn't overestimate their own skills sometimes?

#### d) Availability bias

We tend to overestimate how frequent events that are easy to recall to happen because they occurred recently, or we have experienced them a lot.

#### e) Recency bias

Because of some events happened recently, we think that they will be more likely to occur again than events that happened long ago.

#### f) Illusion of Control

We tend to neglect how much a role luck has to play in the outcomes. We overestimate our control towards the outcomes.

However, in the end of the day, who doesn't make a mistake and be biased towards themselves?
This is the best time we **consult our friends**. Bitter truths feel painful at the moment, but it is better
than the mistakes that could damage you!

Therefore, not just that we ask our friends to be **honest in their opinions**, we need to be honest in our opinions. This
way, we get the clearest views from both inside and outside. (of course, if you think your friend can't take it, 
better be silent ðŸ˜Œ)

Finally, we should establish a base rate of every possible outcome out there. For instance, the base rate of succeeding
in a first-time startup is just <h-link href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=933932">18%</h-link>, 
so what makes us have a confidence that our startup is confirmed to succeed? 

### 4. Think Ahead

Imagine if the worst outcome is to occur, looking back from there and think what could possibly cause it? Similarly,
think ahead if the best outcome happens, what made it happen?

Thinking ahead will allow us to **think in future perspective** and prepare for any issues that may occur. 

## Spending Decision-Making Time More Wisely

If we follow thoroughly the three steps from <h-link go-to="making-better-decisions">Making 
Better Decisions</h-link>, we can barely make 10 decisions a day when there are so many decisions a day. 
Therefore, we need to decide which decision is worth the effort and which we can go fast using the following:

#### 1. The Happiness Test

Does the decision **impact your happiness** in a week, a month or a year. The less impact it has, the faster you can go!

#### 2. Freerolling

Sometimes some decisions **have no negative consequence**. For example, in some shows, we can see people getting quizzed 
for a $10 reward. This is a freerolling case where if you make the right choice, you get an upside potential but there
is no risk. In this case, we can decide more quickly.

#### 3. Sheep in Wolf's Clothing

Some decisions are very **similar to each other in terms of upside and downside potentials**. For instance, when we are 
deciding whether to travel to Australia or Hawaii for our year-end two-weeks holiday. 

It'd be terrible if it ended badly and vice versa. Would it have an effect after 1 week? Definitely.
A month? Probably so. However, if you were to ask yourself, **would I be happy if this is my only choice?** If yes, 
quickly decide, since both choices essentially make no difference.

#### 4. Sorting Strategy

When there are a lot of options, **sort them according to your preference first**, then quickly pick any of those in the top options.
This is especially useful if the options are going to repeat themselves (like what to eat) and you can sort once,
decide many times.

#### 5. Two-Way Door

Certain decisions allow us **to quit and go back**. For example, which restaurant to go today? Certainly it's terrible if the 
food / service turns out to be bad. 

However, if we discover that it's terrible, we always have a choice to stop eating
and go to another restaurant. Furthermore, we get to learn from this bad experience to avoid the restaurant next time.

This is a two-way door decision, where the **opportunity cost** (cost to quit and change decision) is low, we can always
go back if it turns out badly. Thus, we should go fast in this scenario.

#### 6. Decision Stacking

When there is a tough choice with high upside and downside potentials and high opportunity cost, we may be able to 
try and gain more information by **opting for a similar but lower cost choice first before deciding**.

e.g., when deciding to work in a company or not, internship is another option to experience the company's environment
before joining.

#### 7. Parallel Decision

There are times when certain decisions can be **made parallel with other decisions**. For example, using the same restaurant
setting (Sorry for lack of creativity ðŸ˜”), we can always order different food with our friends and share together.

In this way, the downside potential will be reduced, but there might be higher cost (money or sharing the food you like).
Nevertheless, you get to learn about the decisions to help you decide better next time.

## Decision Hygiene

Finally, if we are to consult other people about our decisions, we should keep it **clean**. We shouldn't pollute them with
our opinions or the outcomes as it will affect the advice from them.

On the other hand, we need to be **objective** about what information we knew before making the decision and ensure that
they are aware of it. This way, they can give us the best outside view that we need!

## Conclusion

An amazing book indeed. I might not be able to use all tools given here when making decisions, but now I'm conscious of
what steps I can take to make my decisions better. Then, I'll get to use them when necessary.
